# SamsungInAppPurchaseForUnity
Samsung In App Purchase plugin for Unity

This code is written for Unity 5.1 for use with Samsung In App Purchase SDK 3.0

This code is distributed with a license that says basically "you use, you break something, you buy it"...We are NOT responsible for your unearthly destruction.

The Unity is a licensed product available from Unity at http://unity3d.com/ (We are not responsible for their product...which is pretty awesome BTW!)

Samsung In-App Purchase 3.0 SDK is available at http://developer.samsung.com/in-app-purchase

I will or others add to the code as changes occur, etc or someone else will (if I leave, a earthquake hit and I am died or Zombies have come in which case I may code as a Zombie but for now I'm not sure of Zombie support status)

Thank you for checking out the code repro...

Live Long and Hack the planet....
